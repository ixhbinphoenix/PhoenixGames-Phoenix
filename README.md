Hi there!
====
I'm Phoenix, a hobby developer that mostly codes in javascript
Im also currently tring to learn vue, one of my vue projects is my [newly remade Github Page](https://ixhbinphoenix.github.io)

My current main projects are both discord bots written in discord.js (yes im very good at inventing names, how could you tell?)

- [phx-bot](https://github.com/ixhbinphoenix/phx-bot) for the PHX Guild Discord
- [phoenix-bot](https://github.com/ixhbinphoenix/phoenix-bot) for my [public dev discord](https://discord.gg/gTwuaHW)

They are both based on each other, but contain a more specialized feature set, depending on which bot you use.
For Example, if you use the phx-bot you'll have commands specialized for Hypixel Skyblock related servers, like bprice or verify.

Thank you for your interest in my projects!
